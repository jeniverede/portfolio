                    <br />
                Going into 2024, my career goals revolve around combining my design & UI skills with coding. I'm looking for a full-time role as Frontend or Full-Stack Software Developer for organisations dedicated to causes close to my heart, including those that support animals, the environment, people, businesses or heritage preservation. I aspire to contribute my skills and experience to a nurturing and supportive work environment that values individuality.
