                        She worked very well in a team, was happy to share her knowledge with co-workers and was open-minded towards new things. Due to her professional competence and her trustworthiness, she eventually took over projects completely on her own.

                        Jennifer always worked quickly, independently, with commitment and with an eye on the company's overall processes. She became an extremely valuable employee after only a short time.’</p>
